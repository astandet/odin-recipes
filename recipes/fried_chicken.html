    <h2>Crispy fried chicken with green beans</h2>
    <p>This is the only crispy fried chicken recipe you'll ever need. Why? It combines all the<br> tried-and-true tricks to ensure the juiciest, most flavorful, crispiest chicken every time. </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Mr. Chicken himself</strong>
            <br>Cut a four-pound whole chicken into pieces or purchase four pounds of breasts, drumsticks, wings, legs, and/or thighs at the grocery store.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Buttermilk</strong>
            <br>Acidic buttermilk tenderizes the chicken without making it too tough. Also, it helps the flour mixture stick to the chicken.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Flower.. pardon me, Flour</strong>
            <br>All-purpose flower gives the buttermilk and seasonings something to stick to, while ensuring a wonderfully crispy crust.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Seasonings</strong>
            <br>This crispy fried chicken recipe calls for paprika (which helps with browning), salt, and pepper. You can add more spices and seasonings to taste.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Oil</strong>
            <br>Vegetable oil is perfect for frying chicken because it has a high smoke point. NB: Make sure the oil conforms to the specification 5W30.</p>
