    <h2>Easy Tomato Soup</h2>
    <p>This Creamy Tomato Soup is easy, comforting, and has a rich flavor profile. You can make this tomato soup creamy or chunky if you prefer.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Butter</strong>
            <br>Use unsalted butter to sautee onions.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Yellow onion</strong>
            <br>Onion adds a balanced sweetness.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Garlic</strong>
            <br>You’ll need 1 Tbsp minced from about 3 cloves.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Crushed tomatoes</strong>
            <br>With their juice, preferably San Marzano tomatoes.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Chicken stock</strong>
            <br>For the best flavor use homemade chicken broth.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Basil</strong>
            <br>Chop and add 1/4 cup fresh basil, plus more to serve. Basil leaves are easily bruised so chop by stacking a bunch of leaves then roll them into a log and cut into thin strips. 
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Black pepper</strong>
            <br>Start with 1/2 tsp and add more to taste.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Whipping cream</strong>
            <br>Adds a creaminess to the soup and offsets acidity.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Parmesan cheese</strong>
            <br>Adds saltiness to the soup and balances acidity. Adding parmesan adds enough salt without the need to add more. 
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Saute Aromatics</strong> – heat a non-reactive pot over medium heat. Melt in 4 Tbsp butter then sautee onions until softened and golden (10-12 min). Add minced garlic and saute another minute. </li>
        <p>
            <li><strong>Make the tomato soup base</strong> – stir in two 28 oz cans of crushed tomatoes with their juice, your chicken stock, chopped basil, sugar and black pepper. Bring to a boil then reduce heat, partially cover and simmer 10 minutes.</li>
        </p>
        <p>   
            <li><strong>Blend if desired</strong> – use an immersion blender in the pot or blend in batches using a blender (be careful not to overfill the blender with hot liquid) and return soup to the pot.</li>  
        </p>
        <p>   
            <li><strong>Add cream and parmesan</strong> – stir in the heavy cream and shredded parmesan. Return to a simmer and season to taste if needed.</li>  
        </p>
        <p>   
            <li><strong>Serve</strong> – ladle into warm bowls and garnish with more parmesan and basil. </li>  
        </p>
    </ol>
